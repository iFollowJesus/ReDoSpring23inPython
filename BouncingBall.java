 * 
 * Write a program that simulates a bouncing ball by computing its height in 
 * feet at each second as time passes on a simulated clock. At time zero, 
 * the ball begins at height zero and has an initial velocity supplied by 
 * the user. (An initial velocity of at least 100 feet per second is a good
 * choice.) After each second(--), change the height by adding the current 
 * velocity; then subtract 32 from velocity. If the new height is less than 
 * zero, multiply both the height and the velocity by -0.5 to simulate the 
 * bounce. Stop at the fifth bounce.
 * 
 * Pseudocode:
 * input = 100
 * output
 * time = 0
 * height = 0.0
 * system.out.println("Time: 0 Height: 0.0 ft.")
 * 0.0 double counts down by 32 updates height.... two variable height and new height
 * 0 integer variable counting up from zero until new height<0
 * print bounce
 * while height>0 bounce counter<5 start counter at 1
